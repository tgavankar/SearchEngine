To run:
1. Ensure you have the invlist/body and invlist/title directories
   populated with the appropriate inverted list files. The files
   should be named with <queryterm>.inv and be well-formed.
2. Set the desired options in Config.java
3. Run the JVM with the flag -Xmx512m so that you don't hit 
   out of memory errors for large sets of queries.
4. The main() method is found in SearchEngineRunner.java, so
   you may have to point to that for whatever compiler you are
   using.
